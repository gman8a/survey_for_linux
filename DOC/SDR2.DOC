SDR-2 FIELD OPERATION - POINTS TO KEEP IN MIND.
===============================================

The two main modes of operation of the SDR-2 that have been considered
in the PC-TS program,  1. TRAVERSE and 2. TOPO mode.  These two mode
can be used together to record all field data required. There are a few
basic rules that should be kept in mind:

1.  Always start auto Point numbering at 1000 (on thousand)
    The SDR translation procedure of PC-TS is key around auto point
    numbering beginning at point #1000.

2.  All field control or setup points must be the lower number set.
    ===============================================================
    1, 2, 3, ... 100 ect.
    These control points should be used sequentially ( 1 then 2 then 3, ect);
    If you skip from control pt #5 to say #10 and the try to enter new
    control point I.D.'s  #6,7,8,9. unpredictable result may occur with
    respect to reconition of some obsevation when translation with PC-TS.
    Therefore use the control point I.D. #'s numbers sequentially.
    If you do a spur then continue with sequential control point numbering.
    When ever you are doing control shots you must use the READ-RECORD
    key sequence.  This will allow you to MANUALLY enter the Pt# I.D. #'s
    rather that Auto numbering. (*** All control must be handle this way.*** )

3.  Topo Mode must be recording the RAW obsevation data.
    You should be using topo mode for all of your side shots, this will
    greatly reduce memory consumtion.
    All Vertical Angles are always measured off the Zenith.
    All Horizontal Angles are always turned Right.

4.  You Should Keep a set of legs and target setup on the back sight point
    because the SDR-2 will often ask for a Back sight shot.
    Also more importantly is that when ever you change modes form TOPO
    to TRAVERSE you should take as your FIRST shot the back sight point.
    The SDR translation procedure of PC-TS is keyed around then Back sight
    shot being the first shot of a setup.

5.  If you are doing a traverse, I feel that you should call your first
    setup point #2 rather than pt#1.  You should call the Back Sight from
    Setup Pt#2, Pt#1.  This could avoid some confusion in the office when
    you are coordinating and balancing with PC-TS.  By using this system
    Pt#1 in PC-TS will have the starting coordinates and pt#2 can be
    directly oriented from pt#1.  This will allow you to apply the north
    direction to the system.

6.  Alway put your target heights in and you H.I.'s.  The PC-TS system
    will do point elevation calculations.  If the target height changes
    for one shot to the next use the READ-RECORD key sequence.

7.  The PC-TS conversion procedure will NOT re-enter traverse shots. Therefore
    if you record a traverse shot and it is not correct, then reshot it and NOTE
    in your field book that this traverse shot needs to be edited after the PC-TS
    point file has be created.  Or if you want you can edit the intermediate
    (.70) file and delete the line containing the bad traverse shot, the next
    line should contain the good shot.

8.  Alway capture the PRINTED OUTPUT from the data collector.  This is a good
    record for referal.  All Data Collector COmmunication is handled with PC-TS
    option "CO".
