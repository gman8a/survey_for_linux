 _ Boarder    Enter { 1 } to Draw a Boarder on all sides. { uses pen #2 }
              Enter { 0 } for no Boarder.

 _ Scale      Your Plot will have a scale of:
              1 inch = the number of Units entered into this Field.
              for example Scale of 40 equals  1 inch = 40 Feet.

 _ Rotation   This field Rotates the entire plot " COUNTER CLOCKWISE "
              by the Degrees you specify here.

 _ Offset_X   This Moves the entire Plot in the " X " Direction.
              A minus Number moves the plot to the RIGHT.
              A plus Number moves the plot to the LEFT.
              The Number Specified is interpreted by the computer
              to be in " FEET " of the scale previously specified.
              If your scale is 40 and Offset_X is 200 the plot
              moves 5 inches to the left.
              [ <------ plus ]                  [ minus -------> ]


 _ Offset_Y   This Moves the entire Plot in the " Y "     plus      minus
              Direction. A minus Number moves the plot      |         ^
              UP the Sheet. A plus Number moves the         v         |
              plot DOWN the Sheet. The Number Specified     |         ^
              is interpreted by the computer to be in       v         |
              " FEET " of the scale previously specified.   |         ^
              If your scale is 100 and Offset_Y is 500      v         |
              the plot moves 5 inches DOWN the sheet.

 _ Grid       This field Togles the Grid on and off.
              A { 1 } here has the plotter put a grid on the sheet.
              Each line will be 5 times the scale apart. a scale of
              30 puts a grid on the sheet that is 150' apart.
              A { 0 } in this field shuts off grid.

 _ Line_Ends  There are three settings for this field:

              A { 0 } shuts off line ends until you reset them
              with a " 3 "  or  " 16 "  command. ---------------

              A { 1 } sets a cross hair as the line end -------+

              A { 2 } sets a dot as the line end --------------o


 _ Pt#_Label  There are three settings for this field:

              A { 0 } Shuts off point labels. You can not turn
              them on in the line commands.

              A { 1 } Plots every point in the file and puts the
              point number next to it or the elevation is printed.

              A { 2 } Plots only DESIGNATED Points. This means the
              points that are specified using Line Commands starting
              with a Designated Code. These Codes are:
              1, 2, 3, 5, and 7

 _ Legend     This Field lets you Specify where the Legend is Printed
              on the Sheet.

              A { 0 } Specifies no Legend to be Printed.

              A { 1, 2, 3, ....7, 8 } Specifies a certain location
              on the Sheet ------------------->   Legent Positions
                                                 +-----------------+

              X's Represent Horizantal Position.
              Y's Represent Vertical Position.

 _ Start_Pt#  This Field allows you to Specify which point in the file
              you want the plot to start from. All previous points in
              the file will be disregarded.

Marker Slant stays in effect until next Line Plotted.
Multi_line will draw Markers if the last line drawn had a Marker Drawn.
You can turn X-Hair on/off to cross Circle/Squares or to high lite points.
X-Hair (Line_Ends) on/off is also controlled on the 1st line of the Line file.

Variables Current_Marker & Current_Marker_Size are updated when the
Marker size changes.  All Line Markers use these variables to drawn the
line end markers.  You Can change then end markers with the Set_Marker Code.

You May Put comments in the line file after Label_Types,
   Like  Traverse, Lot Lay Out, Etc.

To Draw Marker using command [6,7] first draw a single line using [0,1]
and turn draw marker on. (ex. 1 12 13 2 0 1 n)

If you do not wish to draw markers with command codes [6,7] then
(ex. 1 12 13 0 1 n) before using [6,7].

There is a variable Draw_Marker that is set on the last line drawn using
command codes [0,1,4,5] not [6,7].

Label Angle (Lab-Ang) is used for labels that are Perpendicular to the line
being labeled.  If Lab_ang>0 then this angle will be used for these labels
else it will be perpendicular.  Lab_ang is off the Due East Line.

If you want a Label to be on the other side of a line then plot the
line in the other direction.

To make thing much easier use comment in the line file to set off blocks
of lines so that you can find them.
Also block line together that are related.

Use code 99 to ignore a command that you might want to restore later.

You can make many things happen with this system by THINKING about it,
This is actually a plotting program language.

Set the orientation of a marker by Marker_slant in Set_marker command
or draw a line with the proper orientation before Draw Marker command.
You might use the no_line code.
The Variable Cur_slant is set either way.  When line are draw with markers
on the markers will get oriented properly automatically.

 _ Change Pens
 =============
 To change pens use the " Pen# " field in Line Codes 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11
 and 16. Pen will change before the line is plotted.

 To change pens for Word Commands Draw a non_line in the vicinity of the
 Words. For example if the words are plotted at point #54, use it in a
 line command:
                   0 54 54 0 9 2 N    *** Set Pen #2 ***

        This draws no line but changes to pen number 2.
        NOTE: It is a good idea to Note such things in
        the file for future referance.


 _ Toggle Line_Ends on or off
 ============================
 To turn off/on line ends use the " X-Hair "  Field in Line Command
 Draw_Marker 3;  or the " Pt_Xhair " Field in the SET VARIABLES 16
 Command. For example set a no marker:

                    99 0 0 0 0 0 0      **** Shut off Line ends ***
                    3 54 0 0 9 0

        This line Draws no marker at point number 54
        and shuts off line ends. Use 99 Command to put
        comment in file

 To use 16 command:

                    99 0 0 0 0 0 0      **** Shut off Line ends ***
                    16 40 0 1 2 1


 _ Set Perpendicular Line Labels at a certain angle for neatness
 ===============================================================
 When using a  V, Z, & P in the " Label _type " Field of Line Commands
 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, & 7, you can set the angle that the label is printed
 by preceding these commands with a SET VARIABLES 16 command and specify
 the angle in the " Perp_Ang " Field:

                    99 0 0 0 0 0 0    ***** Set Perp_Angle at 132 cc ***
                    16 -1 4 132 0 0

        This sets Labels at 132 Deg. Counter Clockwise of Due east of
        the plot. This will stay in effect until you reset it with a
        new angle.

 You can accomplish this using the " Set_Marker " command and specify
 the angle in the " Lab_Ang " Field:

                    99 0 0 0 0 0 0    ***** Set Perp_Angle at 132 cc ***
                    3 0 0 0 9 132

        This accomplishes the same thing.

                                    ( 11 )

 _ To Set Markers at a certain angle
 ====================================
 When using the " Draw_Marker " Command you can set a specific slant to
 the marker using the " Mark_Slant " Field of the " Set_Marker " command.
 You must precede your " Draw_Marker " commands with the " Set_Marker ":

                     99 0 0 0 0 0 0   *** Set Marker Angle at 132 cc ***
                     99 0 0 0 0 0 0    *** Set Marker Mon. { Square } ***
                     3 0 132 4 2 0
                     99 0 0 0 0 0 0    *** Draw Monuments *******
                     3 54 0 4 2 2

 You can also use the  Draw_Line { code 0, 1 } or Traverse Line { code
 4, 5 } or Traverse Polyline { code 10 }  to set marker slant because
 using these line commands the marker slant is set automatically relative
 to the line direction that is drawn. First set the type of marker using
 the " Set_Marker " Command then draw a line calling for markers in the
 " Marker_# " field Then use the " Draw_Marker " Command to draw markers
 at their appropriate Points:

                      99 0 0 0 0 0 0   *** Set Marker Mon. { Square } ***
                      3 0 0 4 2 0
                      0 54 55 3 9 1 n *** Set Marker Angle with line 54-55 ***

                      99 0 0 0 0 0 0  *** Draw Monuments *******
                      3 54 0 4 2 2

        This sets the square as the marker and uses the line
        orientation of the direction of a line between 54 and
        55 to set the marker angle.


 _ Turn off Sheet Tag
 ====================
 When plotting overlays and base sheets you will want to turn off the
 sheet tag for clarity. To do this use the " SET VARIABLES " command.

                       99 0 0 0 0 0 0  *** Shut Off Sheet Tag ***
                       16 0 0 0 0 15
