     The object of Field Cad is to compose maps while in the field.
     ==============================================================

     There are two main advantages to this method of map making.

     1. The map is subject to a direct interpretation of its data by the
        people who are taking the field shots.  This will minimize errors
        of interpretation by office personnel who were not in the field
        and do not have first hand information of the work site.

     2. The time to compose the base maps from a point plot is eliminated.

How to use FIELD CAD.
=====================

   The are two main modes of operation.

Mode 1. Markers are coded using a preset code system for a set of markers.
        This code system is utilized in the field to code markers using two
        digit codes. The first digit would always be the marker command
        code symbol '.' (dot or period), the second digit is the marker code.
        Valid marker codes are 0-9 and A-Z allowing a total of 35 markers
        to be used with field cad;  35 markers is the limit.

        This system of marker coding may be preferred because it minimizes
        the number of characters required to indicate a unique marker.

Mode 2. Markers are coded using key WORDS like MON for MONument.
        The Key words for the markers are entered into a file: MARKER.KEY.

        This mode of operation may be preferred because:
        1. The field workers are already accustom to working with key WORDS
           to indicate markers, hence they would not have to adopt a new
           method of marker coding and can very easily adopted.

        2. Legally speaking a key word would have more wait versus a code
           number because the code number has a greater change of entry error.
           The key word is most always a simple abbreviation of the markers
           real name hence unless the worker thinks he is shooting something
           other than what he is really shooting no errors will occur.


      As the manager you must decide which mode of operation you wish to use.

      Mode 1 is referred to as Marker CODES.
      Mode 2 is referred to as Marker WORDS.

      You can use both modes at the same time if you prefer, that is you
      may enter some description with CODE numbers and others with key WORDS.

        The number corresponds to the marker code and the letters make up
        the key WORD that would be recorded in the field.  This mode does
        NOT require the marker command code '.' prefix.

        This list may easily be customized. The two associated files are:

          1.  MARKER.LN0  which define the line file drawing commands
                          to produce the marker on the plot

          2.  MARKER.KEY  which contains the key WORDS and the associated
                          marker numbers in file: MARKER.LN0.
                          Note: The first marker sequence in the MARKER.LN0
                                file is marker no.1  ect.

How to Draw LINES
=================

      Lines may be draw using a coding system.

      There are 13 different line type that can easily be controlled
      in the field in a few ways.

      All line are considered to be multi. lines, that is that they are
      composed of 1 or more individual lines.

      A line is coded by entering a two digit code.

      The first digit is the line reference no. and ranges from 0 to 7.
      The second digit is the line type and ranges from 0-9 and A B C D.

      All line reference numbers have a default line type.

      The "line reference number" is ALWAYS required as the first digit in
      the point description.  The "line reference no." may be substituted
      with "alternate symbols" to indicate the proper line reference.

      The line type or second digit is not required,  although if entered
      the default line type is suppressed and the entered line type becomes
      associated to the referance line.

      All line reference numbers have an ALTernate reference symbol.
      The "Alternate reference symbols" and "line reference number"
      are completely interchangeable.

      Line Reference      ALTernate Ref.        Default
        Numbers             Symbol             Line Type
      ============        =============       ===========
           0                   =               0 - Solid
           1                   +               1 - Dashed
           2                   -               2 - Dashed Dashed
           3                   *               3 - Long Dashed
           4                   /               4 - Dotted
           5                   O              10 - Stone Wall
           6                   X              11 - Fence
           7                   Y              12 - Stone Wall with Fence


      The Alternate symbols have been chosen to Bring-to-Mind
      their default line types.

      To indicate that a point is to be included in a line; enter
      the line Reference no. or Alt. symbol as the __FIRST__ code
      of the point ID description code.

>>>   A Line Type code only needs to be entered for the first point
      of each line. If a line type code does not follow the Reference
      line no. or alternate symbol for the first point of a line then
      the default line type is used. If the LT code is present then
      the default line type is suppressed.

                                    ex.  2A   ref#2  LT=10  Stone wall
                                         71   ref#7  LT=1   Dashed
                                         *B   ref#4  LT=11  Fence
                                         O0   ref#5  LT=0   Solid
                                         2    ref#2  LT=2   Dashed Dashed
                                         7    ref#7  LT=12  Stone W & Fence
                                         *    ref#4  LT=3   Dotted
                                         O    ref#5  LT=10  Stone Wall


      After the first point of a line has been shot all remaining points
      of that line can be coded as a single Line ref. no. or alt. symbol.
      However you may code both the ref. no. and the line type for all
      points on the line.  Many data collector will repeat a description
      code hence the Ref# and LT may occur thur out the line.

>>>   The LAST point on the line or the END of the line is coded by
      entering a '9' as the second digit
                                     ex.  19  ends ref line #1
                                          -9  ends ref line #1
                                          79  ends ref line #7
                                          =9  ends ref line #2

>>>   The LAST point may also be coded by entering two alternate symbols
      codes as the first and second characters.
                                     ex.  --  ends ref line #1
                                          YY  ends ref line #7
                                          ++  ends ref line #0
                                          ==  ends ref line #2

>>>   The END line commands can only be coded as shown in the examples above.
      A double Reference no. (22) will NOT end a line.

      Generally if using "Line Reference no."  0-7 then the alternate
      symbol of the referance no. will not be used to refer to the line.
      For example consider this coding:
                                               10
                                               1
                                               1DH
                                               +
                                               19

      Here the '+' alt. symbol was substituted while still shooting
      the line.  This is OK except, if the symbol and ref. no. do not
      correspond then another new line has been started.
      For this reason if you commence a line with a ref. no. then use
      the ref. no. for that line to completion.  Conversely if you
      commence a line with an alternate symbol then use the symbol to
      refer to the line to completion.  This is simply good practice.


Marker that fall on Lines  (LINE:MARKERS)
=========================================

>>>   If a marker fall on a line then code the Line first and the marker
      second.  ***  There are no exception to this rule.  ***
      Lines are always coded first and as the first characters of the
      description code.

      Using WORD Key Marker mode.
      ===========================
      The only quirk occurs when  the "Line:Marker" is the first point
      of a line. "Line:Marker" means a marker falls on a line.

      Example: If coded  '=DH' then the 'D' here will change the default
      line type to 13.   ( Note: LT codes are 0123456789ABCD.)
      You may have intended a LT#0 (solid line) but you will get a
      double line (LT#13).
      This quirk only happens when a key WORD begin with a letters ABC or D.

>>>   The simple remedy of this quirk is to code the first point of
      Line:Markers with a 2 digit line code followed by the key WORD
      or marker CODE no.

                         ex.  = DH       LT=2    (default)
                              =4DH       LT=4
                              32DH       LT=2
                              3 DH       LT=3    (default)
                              31.6       LT=1

>>>    If your key WORD code begin with 'E' or greater then there is no
       problem.
       But as a general rule if the first point of a line is also a
       marker (Line:Marker) then enter a 2 digit line code.
       The space character is very handy when the default line type
       is desired.

       If you ignore this rule, the chances are that this quirk will
       not happen much because most words begin with letters greater than 'D'.
       The marker WORDs that begin with ABC or D have been flagged above
       with an asterisk *. There are only a few and most of them probily
       would not commence a line anyway.
       In other words the key WORD can directly follow the line Reference no.
       The marker will always be interpreted properly, and only in the
       incidence where a "Line:Marker starts a line and the marker begins
       with letters ABC or D" can the line type be altered.  This does
       not pose a grave problem even if it does occur because only a single
       code need be changed in the line file to correct the line type.

       Following is a chart of line types and referance numbers:

          The above chart show the 13 possible line types that may be
          coded for in the field by using the LINE TYPE no. for the
          desired LT.             ex.
                                     26    Ref. Line 2 LT 6
                                     2     Ref. Line 2 LT 2 (default)
                                     =     Ref. Line 0 LT 0 (default)
                                     5     Ref. Line 5 LT A (default)
                                     55    Ref. Line 5 LT 5
                                     O     Ref. Line 5 LT A (default)

          As you can see almost anything goes for indicating a line.
          If you need to draw more that one line at the same time
          with the same line type then use the line REFERENCE numbers
          instead of the alternate symbols to avoid confusion.
          ex. Need to draw 2 pavement lines:
                                             00      Ref# 0 LT=0

                                             0DH     Line 0 with Drill Hole
                                             1FH     Line 1 with Fire Hyd.
                                             0       Line 0 continued
                                             1.1"IP  Line 1 with a 1"IP
                                             0       Line 0 continued

             The above example may also be coded other ways:
                                             =       Ref# 0 LT=0 (default)
                                             -0      Ref# 1 LT=0
                                             =DH     Line 0 with Drill Hole
                                             -FH     Line 1 with Fire Hyd.
                                             =       Line 0 continued
                                             - 1"IP  Line 1 with 1"IP
                                             =       Line 0 continued
                                             -IP     Line 1 with Iron Pin
                                             ==      END Line 0
                                             --      END Line 1

>>>    Another more important quirk is when using key WORDS that
       include a numbers as part of the description.
                           1"PIPE.  or 1/2"IP
       Why ?
       The no. will be interpreted as a line ref. no. or a line type.
       Any number from 0-7 as the first character of the description
       code will be interpreted as a "line referance number".

       To solve the problem code the no. after the key WORD.
                            PIPE 1".

       If this situation occurs for a Line:Marker then there is no problem.
                           1 1"PIPE      use a space before the description.

***    This quirk situation should be kept in mind when recording markers. ***

       Another remedy is to enter the marker CODE no. The program
       scans for the marker CODE no. before checking for the key WORDS.
                           .31"PIPE

       If the marker CODE no. is not known then code a space after '.',
       which will be interpreted as a bad marker CODE causing the
       key WORD to be interpreted.
>>>                        . 1"PIPE      ***  THIS IS THE BEST WAY  ***
                           ..1"PIPE

       Here the '..' code may be thought of as a NO Line or NO Marker sequence.
       The '..' code is the best solution to this quirk because everything
       comes out correct, and it is a simple exception rule to remember.

       If you put .1"PIPE then the program will use marker no. 1 with
       a description "PIPE.

***    AS A GENERAL RULE PUT NUMBERS AFTER THE KEY WORDS.
                           PIPE 1"
       OR CODE like
                           ..1"PIPE

       If this quirk is ignored then a line has commenced.  This does not
       pose much of a problem because the marker will still plot and the
       error can easily be detected after the first plot.
