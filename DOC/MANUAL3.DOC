Overview of PC Turbo Survey:

    PC Turbo survey (PC-TS) is an IBM XT computer based program that
    will greatly increase the productivity of land surveyors and land
    development engineers. PC-TS is based around a coordinate
    geometry system. The system incorporates new methods for handling
    data input from the user making data entry easy and
    comprehendable even by an inexperienced technician.

    All input data is retained by the computer for editing or
    modification as desired. The system will automatically reduce
    field notes to XYZ coordinates. The user can enter azimuths,
    horizontal angles (left or right), or bearing as desired.
    Automatic horizontal distances are calculated for slope
    distances, rod shot distances or EDM distances. Traverse loops
    are balanced using the compass method. The balance procedure also
    balances vertical data in a closed loop. Vertical and horizontal
    calculations are done with two separate processes allowing the
    user to complete horizontal calculations and at another time
    enter vertical data to compute elevations of points.

    A full feature plotting system is available which produces fast
    accurate plots. The plot system has 16 commands with 12 different
    line types 15 different symbol types, automatic line labeling,
    automatic legend, shape building capabilities, full featured text
    manipulation, digitizing link, and more!  Area calculations are
    accomplished using three methods of data input, area point file,
    key board input, and digitizer input.  Another major feature is
    auto point find; this means if you digitize a point and that
    point exists in the point file then the actual coordinates of
    that point are used rather than the approximate point coordinates
    that the digitizer delivers to the system.

Coordinant geometry functions include:

    1. Line line intersection. 2. Line arc intersection. 3. Arc arc
    intersection. 4. Line point intersection (perpendicular). 5.
    Offset (find intersection of lines offset from two other known
    lines). 6. Line arc tangent. 7. Point point (inverse).

    Another function is a radial stake out. This funtion allows you
    to set up at any point, back sight any other point, and then
    enter points to be staked out.

TC-TS Operational Information.
==============================
     There is 1 main menu that is activated by pressing '?' key.
     The menu contains groups of all the options of the PC-TS system.
     Each menu group has a help screen that can be viewed by entering
     the help screen number.  These help screens are in the file
     HELP.DOC.  This file must be on the disk for help to work.

AD - Add points to file.
     This option is the main way to get data into the computer from
     your field book.  It will allow you to enter both horizontal and
     vertical data. First you enter a From point number.  This number must
     be less than the point number of the point you are entering.  If
     you want to enter coordinates directly then enter zero(0) for
     the From point number.  Note: This is called a From point system and
     is dynamic in nature. This means that all points have been
     created by coming from another point unless the From point
     number is zero. Being dynamic in nature means that if a From
     point (of a point) changes coordinates then the point defined
     from the From point can change if the dynamic system is active.
     Points can be deactivated from the dynamics of the From point
     system by entering a 0 or negative From point in the From point
     data position.

Back Site Point (BSPt).
     This point is the back site point of the From point.  If you are
     using angles turned left or right then the BS point is used.
     The BS angle is usually zero but can be modified as desired for
     each point entered.  The BS angle edit option is set on under
     option SE-SEtting.  If the BS point is greater than the From
     point then the From point is automatically protect from dynamic
     interaction.  This is necessary to maintain the integrity of the
     dynamic point system. Why? During recalculation of the point
     system the computer works from lower point number to higher
     point number.  OK, now a particular point gets dynamically
     updated with a BS point > From point.  It is now possible that
     the BS point can also get dynamically updated hence the intended
     BS angle changed.  So to avoid this as stated above if a BS
     point > From point then the BS point gets protected.

Setup:
     This is a YES/NO option, it simple tells the user if this point
     is a setuppoint. It is also linked to the HI data position in
     that if Setup is NO then you can not enter an HI to the HI data
     position. While we are on the subject of HI, this is required so
     that vertical calculation can be dynamically carried through.
     Important: Since this is a dynamic system of data points, if you
     setup on a point with a new HI value and other points have
     already been calculated with the old HI then to maintain the pt
     elevations properly you must handle this one of two ways. 1.
     Protect all the points that use the first HI so that during
     dynamic point update there elevation remains intact. 2. Duplicate
     the Setup point to another point then use the duplicate point as
     the From point for your new point observation data.  You can
     safely enter any HI value this way with out corrupting other
     points.

    ****  You must remember that this is a Dynamic System of Points.  ****

Description:
     This is a 20 character field that is use to describe a point. It
     can be any data you wish.  It is strongly recommended that a
     description of some type be entered for eachpoint. The reason is
     that you can quickly tell what a point is in the field, and
     during cogo operations.

Azimuth:
     This field is used for entering angle data to a point. You enter
     an azimuth in the DDD-MM-SS format. There are 3 optional letters
     that also can go in this field: 1:  A - for azimuth. 2:  R -
     Right angle. 3:  L - Left angle.

     There are two ways to define direction, by (1) azimuth or angle
     turned right or left.  All angle input methods can be handled
     from the AZIMUTH data entry position and the HZ-ANG field with
     the above options. If you enter an R or L  the next added point
     will use the angle turn method by default, and the entry will be
     in the HORZANG data entry position. From the HORZANG data entry
     position you may use the above 3 letters (A,R,L) to toggle
     between entry modes at will. The BEARING data entry position can
     be used by entering a bearing (ex. SW 10-20-30 or 30-40-10 NE or
     s25-20e ). You optionally enter data in this field after the
     AZIMUTH data is entered. You may press the <RETURN> key from the
     AZIMUTH data field to jump directly to the BEARING field.  If
     you enter a valid bearing then the previous entry to the AZIMUTH
     field is ignored.

Distance:
     This data entry field is used to enter a distance in 1 of 4
     ways. 1: H - Horizontal 2: R - Rod shot with vertical angle. 3:
     P - Prism shot using a total station. 4: E - EDM shot.

     The formulas that reduce the slope distance for these type of
     shots are activated by entering a letter (H,R,P,E) with the
     distance.  The default method letter will show when you enter
     the DISTANCE data entry field.  You do not need to type the
     default letter if this is the method required for the distance
     data enter. If R,P,E is used then the next data entered will be
     the vertical angle of that shot.

Important:

     All vertical angles are measured from the zenith, hence 90-00-00
     is a level shot >90 is down hill <90 is up hill.  If the
     vertical angle is greater than 180 then it is reduced,  Vert_Ang
     = 360 - VA.

Rod (Rod shot):

     If you want elevations to be calculated you must enter a rod
     shot. After entering the rod shot then the computer will ask you
     for either the delta elevation or the vertical angle, depending
     on the input mode set in the SEtting option. Delta elevations
     are computed by Total stations.  If your instrument reads out
     delta elevation then it is much quicker to enter delta elevation
     than vertical angles.  However, if you are entering DISTANCE data
     in the (Rod, Prism, EDM) mode then you must use the vertical
     angle input mode, the vertical angle will already be entered for
     vertical calculation so that you may press the <RETURN> key when
     the cursor jumps back to the Vert_Ang data entry position. If
     you enter a rod shot of 0 then you may enter an elevation
     directly. Remember that 0.000 elevation is handled as if no
     elevation is present for this point.

HI:
     The HI is used for vertical calculation of points that come from
     the point being entered.  This value can only be set if Setup is
     YES.

EDit option:
     The edit option is used to fix errors in data entry. It operates
     the same as the add option.


INsert point option:
     This option is used to insert a point, all points are shifted
     down so that a point can be inserted.  This is used rarely: Say
     that you are entering map data to check the map, after entering
     100 legs you find out 1 leg has been left out. You may insert
     this leg so that the map check will close. Be aware that point
     numbers will change, You might not want point numbers to change.
     INsert will ask you for a point numbers to begin the downward
     point shift.  From points and BS points will automatically be
     adjusted for the point shift. The inserted point will have 0
     data entries, therefore you should use the edit option to enter
     the proper data for the inserted point.

SD- Set Digitizer
     The standard digitizer driver is a Houston Instruments full size
     pad. This option is used to set a page on the digitizer. Every
     time a page is placed on the digitizer the SD command must be
     used. First you digitize a origin point. This origin point must
     be a point with either known coordinates or a known point
     number.  Next, the computer asks if you wish to enter
     coordinates or point numbers. Point numbers are quicker to enter
     than coordinates. Next you are asked if you want to orient the
     plot page by a Grid on the page or by AZIMUTH (another known
     point). Most of the time two known points are known, so that the
     new page can be set quickly.  The X-Y scales are then calculated
     so that you can be sure everything is correct. Note: you can use
     the grid orientation to set for a double scale drawing (like a
     road profile) to obtain areas for cut-fill calculations. After
     Set Digitizer is complete the digitizer pad becomes an active
     part of the Survey System.

DA-Digitizer Add
     This option is used to get coordinate data from the digitizer
     quickly into the point file.

Notes on digitizer:
     The digitizer utilizes a point search function to return a
     existing point in the point file.  This feature is utilized by
     pressing the #1 key on the digitizer key pad.  If the #1 key is
     used and an existing point is not found then no point is
     returned.  If you want the coordinates of a point that does not
     exist in the point file then you should press the #2 key.  An
     audio sound indicates if an existing point has been found.   The
     #3 key will not search for an existing point, this is useful for
     digitizing points that are close together such as U.S.G.S.
     contours. If you use any other key except the 3 key then the
     program will search for an existing point.

AR-ARea Computation
     There are 3 ways that areas can be computed: 1:Keyboard  - Point
     data comes from the keyboard. 2:Digitizer - Point data comes
     from the digitizer. 3:File - Point data comes from a file.

     The file input is very useful because a record of the areas is
     kept and can easily be modified.  The file format is as follows:
     ex. 001  1 3 6 9 12 -13 -14 50 0 55 33 1 Subdivision Lot #1 In
     the above example the 1st number represents the lot number for
     identification.  This number may be any integer type number. If
     this number is <0 then an area accumulator will print its value
     and then reset to 0. Next you enter the point numbers of the area
     you want, consecutively. For circles enter PC as a positive
     number, the center as a negative number and the PT + or -
     depending if the arc chord area is included or not included.
     Above circle is 12 -13 -14. You may also use thru point
     numbering in both directions. This is accomplished by entering
     the starting point then a 0 to indicate THRU then the ending
     point number.  All of the point numbers between will be included
     in the area calculations. Above  50 0 55 means 50 51 52 53 54 55
     Finally you must close the area with the first number entered.
     You may also enter an optional comment to aid in lot
     identification. The keyboard input area function works
     identically to the file input area function. The digitizer input
     is simple. Setup the digitizer (SD),  now digitize the desired
     area.  To close the area Press the * key on the cursor pad.  The
     cursor need not be over the closure pt again to close.  Also you
     may keep digitized points for another area calculation.  This is
     useful to get the exact size for a specified lot area.  If you
     do not want to keep any points press 00 on the cursor keypad. To
     exit press then # key on the pad. While in the digitize mode all
     computer control is through the digitizer keypad.  You may also
     redigitize a incorrect point by digitizing the correct point
     with the 9 key. If you want get the area of points that are
     already in the data base then use the 1 key,  this will cause
     only data base points to be returned to the area calculation
     matrix.  Use the 2 key to digitize any point into the area
     calculation matrix.

OF-OFfset cogo function.
     This function is very useful for finding circle center points for
     reverse curves.  It will intersect two lines that are offset
     perpendicularly to two known lines.  Offset right is clock-wise,
     left Counter Clock-wise.

Balance
     The balance procedure uses the compass rule to balance
     coordinates. First you enter the CLOSE TO Pt#,  this allows you
     to close any loop.  The traverse should be run in the following
     manner in order for the balance system to work properly: Pt#1 is
     used for the coordinate base.  Pt#2 comes from Pt#1 and is used
     to orient the survey, with a starting azimuth. Pt#3 comes from
     Pt#2 BS to Pt#1 and is the first angle turned.


The following is an example of how to balance a traverse loop:

Example.    Point #1 is a the first setup and part of the loop.
            Say there are 5 points in the traverse loop.

            Pt#    FromPt#   BSPt#

            2        1         0      use to enter azimuth for orientation
            3        2         1      1st loop angle
            4        3         2      2nd loop angle
            5        4         3      3rd loop angle
            6        5         4      4th loop angle (RETURN to pt# 1)
            7        6         5      5th loop angle (closing ang., Dist.=0.0')
            1                         ends input

            Close to PT = 1
            The BS_points must be set even if you traverse with aszmiths.

     Plotting is accomplished by entering a series of simple commands
     into a file that has the same name as the point file that you
     are using, plus the file extension .LN (ex. Mt-View.LN).
     The commands are entered into the file using the editor 'ED'
     or PC-TS option 'EE' or by pressing 'F10' key.
     The baud rates and other serial parameters are set using option 'CO'.

AN-Angle math.
     This option is for adding and subtracting angles.  If you want
     to use a bearing instead of an angle press <RETURN> at the Enter
     angle ? prompt and the computer will ask for a bearing.  Press
     the equal sign (=) to terminate angle math.

CU-Curve computations.
    This option is used to calculate varibles of a circle given any
    two variables.

Important:
     Make sure you use the exit function (EX) before turning the
     computer off. This will tell MS-DOS to flush disk write buffers,
     assuring that no point data is lost.

                       display regiter set by the Next Number.

  Shift     F1-F10     Get Number from the displayed register set.

  Control   F1-F10     Get the Number of Point - Function Key value.
                       F10 alway is equal to the current Number of Points.
                       This is only active in the Point or Integer input mode.

  Control   F1-F10     Get User Register Angle and ask R ight L eft or A szmith.

Notes: When storing a number in a user register the first key sequence pressed
       must be the one of then Register Storage key sequences above.

       Next, use the comment symbom '{' to tell the user the input data
       description.

       Next, If the user is to input this data then cause an input error.
       The best way for points and real numbers is to type a short prompt
       for the input data. This will serve as an additional input prompt.
       If the input data is azimuth then cause the error by entering --.
       If the input data is description then cause error by entering : or ;.

IF THEN ELSE Operation
======================

IF is the menu option to activate the IF function.
IF should only be used when program a Script in the Learn Mode.

EI (END IF) is required to end all IF block script.

Example #1

IF Register #1 > Register #2 then
   PP 1 2
   PP 3 4
   PP 4 5
ENDIF (EI)

In the above example if the argument evaluates true then three Point/Point
Operation will be performed.

Example #2

IF Register #1 > Register #2 then
   PP 1 2
   PP 3 4
   PP 4 5
ELSE  (ES)
   PP 6 7
   PP 8 9
   PP 9 10
ENDIF (EI)

In example #2 if the argument is false the the ELSE block of script will
be performed.

NESTED IF Statments (10 Levels)
===============================

IF R1 > R2 then
  PP 1 2
  PP 3 1
ELSE IF R3 = R4 then
       PP 3 4
       PP 4 2
     ELSE IF R5 < R6 then
            PP 6 7
            PP 8 9
            PP 10 11
          ELSE PP 20 30
          ENDIF
     ENDIF
ENDIF

In the above example only one block of script will be performed.
This program structure is the same as the Pascal CASE statement.



At any Input Time you may use the follow control characters.
============================================================

{  Begin Comment Line
&  Extented Comment Line (used as the last character in a comment line)
   Then Press the Comment Symbol '{' again to enter the next part of
   the comment.
!  Wait Until Keypressed (User Pause)
$  Delay 1 second

Do not use these characters in the Description of a point.


LINE FILE DRAWING TEMPLETE
==========================
To write a Line File Drawing Templete use SideKick to edit file DRAW.LN.
All templetes are put in this file.

Give the Templete a name and put two colons after it.
Then enter the line drawing commands using the # sign to indicate
point numbers that will be modified with a point offset.

Example

ROAD-CURVE::  Draw C.L. and edges of road arcs
2 #2 #5 #1 1 1 p
2 #3 #6 #1 0 1 p
2 #4 #7 #1 1 1 p


Use DR-DRaw Template in PC-Turbo Survey.
This procedure will ask for an offset to add to the points with a # sign
in front of them (as shown above).
The result output of this procedure is appended to a line file .LNZ.
This line file (.LNZ) should be block read ^KR with SideKick into the
line file that the user is building.
