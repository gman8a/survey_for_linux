Marker Slant stay in effect until next Line Plotted.
Multi_line will draw Markers if the last line drawn had a Marker Drawn.
You can turn X-Hair on/off to cross Circle/Squares or to high lite points.
X-Hair (Line_Ends) on/off is also controlled on the 1st line of the Line file.

Varables Current_Marker & Current_Marker_Size are updated when the
Marker size changes.  All Line Markers use these variables to drawn the
line end markers.  You Can change then end markers with the Set_Marker Code.

You May Put comments in the line file after Label_Types,
   Like  Traverse, Lot Lay Out, Ect.

To Draw Marker using command [6,7] first draw a single line using [0,1]
and turn draw marker on. (ex. 1 12 13 2 0 1 n)

If you do not wish to draw markers with command codes [6,7] then
(ex. 1 12 13 0 1 n) before using [6,7].

There is a variable Draw_Marker that is set on the last line drawn using
command codes [0,1,4,5] not [6,7].

Label Angle (Lab-Ang) is used for labels that are Perpendicular to the line
being labeled.  If Lab_ang>0 then this angle will be used for these labels
else it will be perpendicular.  Lab_ang is off the Due eEast Line.

If tyou want a Label to be on the other side of a line then plot the
line in the other direction.

To make thing much easier use comment in the line file to set off blocks
of lines so that you can find them.
Also block line together that are related.

Use code 99 to ignor a command that you might want to restore later.

You can make many things happen with this system by THINKING about it,
This is actually a plotting program langauage.

Set the orentation of a marker by Marker_slant in Set_marker command
or draw a line with the proper orientation before Draw Marker command.
You might use the no_line code.
The Variable Cur_slant is set either way.  When line are draw with markers
on the markers will get oriented properly automatically.
