Overview of PC Turbo Survey:

    PC Turbo survey (PC-TS) is an IBM XT computer based program that
    will greatly increase the productivity of land surveyors and land
    development engineers. PC-TS is based around a coordinate
    geometry system. The system incorporates new methods for handling
    data input from the user making data entry easy and
    comprehendable even by an inexperienced technician.

    All input data is retained by the computer for editing or
    modification as desired. The system will automatically reduce
    field notes to XYZ coordinates. The user can enter azimuths,
    horizontal angles (left or right), or bearing as desired.
    Automatic horizontal distances are calculated for slope
    distances, rod shot distances or EDM distances. Traverse loops
    are balanced using the compass method. The balance procedure also
    balances vertical data in a closed loop. Vertical and horizontal
    calculations are done with two separate processes allowing the
    user to complete horizontal calculations and at another time
    enter vertical data to comput elevations of points.

    A full feature plotting system is available which produces fast
    accurate plots. The plot system has 16 commands with 12 different
    line types 15 different symbol types, automatic line labeling,
    automatic legend, shape building capabilities, full featured text
    manipulation, digitizing link, and more! Area calculations are
    accomplished using three methods of data input, area point file,
    key board input, and digitizer input.  Another major feature is
    auto point find; this means if you digitize a point and that
    point exists in the point file then the actual coordinates of
    that point are used rather than the approximate point coordinates
    that the digitizer delivers to the system.

Coordinant geometry functions include:

    1. Line line intersection. 2. Line arc intersection. 3. Arc arc
    intersection. 4. Line point intersection (perpendicular). 5.
    Offset (find intersection of lines offset from two other known
    lines). 6. Line arc tangent. 7. Point point (inverse).

    Another function is a radial stake out. This funtion allows you
    to set up at any point, back sight any other point, and then
    enter points to be staked out.

Hardware specifications:

    IBM PC computer system or compatable system with 256 K RAM, color
    or monochrome monitor, one floppy disk drive and one printer.
    PC-TS is configured for use with a Houston Instruments DMP-52
    plotter and a Houston Instruments large digitizer pad.

Software specifications:

    MS-DOS operating system, an editing system i.e. Sidekick (many
    good screen editors are available in the public domain), and a RAM
    disk system i.e. VDISK (a memory emulated disk drive).

Prefered system:

   IBM PC computer system with extended memory, one floppy drive, one
   hard drive, one printer and two communication ports (one for a
   Houston instruments plotter and one for a Houston Instruments
   large digitizing pad).  An editing system is necessary to run
   PC-TS.  Many good editing systems exist and the user can make his
   own choice however, the preferred editor is the Sidekick editor by
   Borland Inc. because of its abilty to interact simultaneously with
   any applications program system.

System configuration file (config.sys):

   PC-Turbo Survey requires a Ram drive.  This is accomplished by
   entering the following line in the system CONFIG.SYS file.
   VDISK.SYS is a RAM disk driver that is on MS DOS 3.0 and greater
   versions.  This file should be located in the root directory of
   the boot disk so that CONFIG will find it with the following
   config entries: (If you are running DOS 2.1 and do not have
   VDISK.SYS then use the ramdisk programs supplied on the PC-TS
   distribution disk instead of VDISK.SYS)

   1. hard disk & floppy disk system CONFIG.SYS entry
   device=vdisk.sys 64

or if you use the RAM disk program supplied with PC-TS

   device=rdisk.sys

Note: vdisk.sys will work on a 2.0 versions system

Printer Setting:

   Your the printer should be set for the condensed print mode.  A
   program is on the disk for setting Epson printer and compatable
   printers for the condensed print mode.  To set your Epson printer
   to the condensed print mode, at the MS DOS prompt type PRNSET
   <RETURN>.

Installation:

   To install PC-TS onto your hard disk, boot the system, insert the
   PC-TS diskette into the A drive, log the A drive by typing A:
   <RETURN>, and then type HDINST <RETURN>. For a floppy disk system
   first boot your computer with a MS DOS operating system (2.1 or
   greater), then insert PC-TS into the B drive and log the B drive
   by typing B: <RETURN> and then type FLOPINST <RETURN>.

To start PC-TS:

   Type TS filename  <RETURN>
   (for example TS newyork <RETURN>)

List of some of the options and explainations:

     There are seven main menus that are activated by pressing the F1-F7 keys.
     These menus contain all the options of the system.
     Each menu has a help screen that can be viewed by pressing the F10 key
     while the menu is displayed.  These help screens are in the file
     HELP.DOC.  This file must be on the disk for help to work.
     The following is the HELP.DOC file.  You may customize the help to your
     particular descriptions of the functions.

POINT INPUT OPERATIONS::
AD - Add points to file, Full control of point data input.
ED - Edit an existing point in the point file.
DE - Delete points, Flag points as deleted. Only points at the end of the
     file can actually be deleted from the file (clean up).
IN - Insert a point into the file. Insert will shift points down in the file.
     The From_pt and BS_pt of the shifted points are modified as required.
     Insert is used if you leave out a leg of a traverse or map boundary.
EL - Modify existing point elevation without changing the rest of the point
     data record.  If you have recorded field Delta elevation then use the
     SEtting command to modify elevation using delta information.
TP - ToPo data input.  Much like Side Shot (SS) except the rod reading is
     entered so that the elevation can be calculated.  Also you must exit
     TP to modify the FROM:Pt# and BS:Pt.  This makes the data entry faster.
SS - Side Shot.  Quick method of adding horizontal point data.  Use Side
     Shot instead of ADD.
MC - Map Check.  Quick method of adding horizontal point data from a boundary
     map.  The from point and back sited point will automatically advance.
     You may enter the distance with the letter 'H' to Hold the From point.
GP - Get Points. To get a range of data points from another point file
     and append these points to the current logged file.
AM - Append Move.  To append blank point data to the point file and also
     to move a block of existing points in the point file.  You may append
     points so that a group of points will get numbered as desired.
     Note: Do not append large blocks of blank points with no intention
     of using them.
RE - REvise data in existing point records, You may revise the FROM:Pt#,
     BS:Pt#, Setup, Description, and the rod shot.  This option is used if
     many point are entered with the wrong data.
QS - QuickShot is like Side Shot except you can not control then FROM:pt#
     and the BS:Pt#.

COORDINATE GEOMETRY FUNCTIONS::
LL - Line Line intersection. Each line is defined by a starting point and
     a direction from that point number.
LP - Line point intersection.  This option finds the point of intersection
     of two lines one of which is perpendicular to the other and intersects
     the point.
LA - Line arc intersection. Finds the intersection points of a given line
     with a given arc.
LT - Line arc tangent. Finds a line tangent to a given arc and intersecting
     a given point.
AA - Arc arc intersection.  Finds intersection points of two given arcs.
PP - Point to point (inverse). Finds distance and bearing between two
     known points.
OF - Offset point. Finds the intersection of two lines that are parallel to
     two known lines. An offset distance (left or right) from each known line
     is required.

CALCULATION PROCEDURE::
AN - Angle math. This function adds and subtracts azimuths and bearings.
     The sum total will always be less than 360.
CU - Curve calculations. This function solves for unknown variables of
     a simple curve given two of the following; radius, delta, length,
     tangent, and long chord.
CC - Compare Coordinates.  Used to compare Northing and Easting point
     coordinates.  This is useful if you are working with another person's
     map and your own field data.
AR - Area Calculation.  This function calculates the area of a known point
     loop.  You may traverse curves and lines.  Three data input methods
     types can be chosen (keyboard input, disk-file input, and digitizer
     input).
SO - Stake Out.  Used to do radial state out of given points from a given
     point Back sight to another given point.  Use the <PrtScr> key to
     send the output data to the screen.
ST - STation on curves.  This function will calculate and add stations points
     around a curve to the point file.  Before using STation you must have
     found the PT, PC, Center point of the curve.  You may enter the station
     increment (50,100) and the offset distance from the PC.
VC - Vertical Curve.  Finds the elevation along a vertical curve given the
     PVC, PVT, Grade#1, Grade#1, PVI elevation.
FW - Find Window.  Finds the maximum & minimum northing and easting limits
     of a range of coordinates.  Used mostly to to find display window limits
     for plotter setup parameters.

POINT COORDINATE MODIFICATION PROCEDURES::
RT - Rotate Translate.  This function rotates points about a given point
     using a given counter clockwise rotation angle.  Also Translation of
     a point range may be accomplished simultaneously. You may accomplished
     each function without the other.  After point rotation/translation is
     complete the points are protected (negative From_pt).
BA - Balance Traverse.  Balances a closed loop of traverse points using the
     compass rule.  Refer to MANUAL.DOC for more data.  All traverse point
     must have the SETUP option set to YES and all consecutive traverse
     points must come from the preceding traverse point.

POINT DATA OUTPUT FUNCTIONS::
PR - PRint points coordinates and other point info to the printer.
TA - TAg printer page. Prints a Time, date, and File name tag to the printer.
BR - Browse point.  Used to look at point data on the screen. Four points
     are displayed at once.  You may use the cursor keypad to control point
     display.  Active keys are ESC, HOME, END, PgUp, PgDw, ArrowUp ArrowDown.
TO - TOggle printer on and off.  All functions that print data are linked to
     a printer ON/OFF variable.  If you do not want printer output then TOggle
     the printer off.  The state of this variable is displayed at the bottom
     of the screen (PRT:TRUE).  Printer Off is a good state while adjusting
     Lot area sizes in conjunction with Area (AR) file input mode.
PL - PLot points using the line file.  (See manual for more info.) This
     option invokes the interpretation of a line file (user created) to
     make a plotted image of the point file.  This is a very powerful plotting
     system and will require some time and practice to understand. However
     the plot system is simple in nature so that you may make a plot for your
     very first job.
DX - DXf file creation.  This function will created a file that is compatible
     with AUTOCAD.  AUTOCAD can read coordinate pairs in from this file and
     you may use function of AUTOCAD to make a drawing.

DIGITIZER FUNCTIONS::
SD - Set Digitizer.  Use to set a sheet on the digitizing pad. Proper
     orientation of a sheet is first required so that digitized
     coordinates can be utilized.  You can orient the sheet by using grid
     on the sheet or by using two known points on the sheet.
DA - Digitizer Add. Used to add a serious of points to the point file from
     the digitizing pad.  The Set Digitizer (SD) function must have been
     used prior to using the Digitizer Add (DA) function.
MS - Make Shape.  This is an advance function that is used to get
     coordinate pairs from the digitizer for the purpose of producing a
     shape file for the plot function.  The coordinate pairs are stored
     in a shape file in ASCII form.  This shape file is then loaded into
     an editor and Plot line drawing commands are build around the pairs
     to produce a shape that can be draw.  (See Manual for more info).

PROTECT FUNCTIONS:
PC - Protect Coordinates.  Negates From point.  A negative or zero from point
     will protect the coordinates from being modified by the dynamic system.
UC - Unprotect Coordinates.  Will set the From point positive and allow the
     coordinates to be modified by the recalculation dynamics.
PE - Protect Elevation.  Negates Rod Shot.  A negative or zero rod shot
     will protect the elevation from being modified by the dynamics system.
UE - Unprotect Elevation. Will set the rod shot positive and allow the
     elevation to be modified by the recalculation dynamics.

OTHER OPERATION::
EX - EXit to MS-DOS.  You must use the EX option before you turn the computer
     off.  This is important so that MS-DOS will flush disk write buffers.
     If you turn the system off with out EXiting from PC-TS then some point
     data may be lost.
FL - FLush point data to the disk.  This option should be used frequently
     to assure that no point data is lost due to a power failure or shut
     down before the EXit option is used.
SC - Set Cursor. Used to set the cursor type to your preferance.
SE - Settings.  You may set the Angle input type, whether or not to edit the
     back sight angle.  Also how you wish to enter vertical data, either
     as vertical angles from the zenith or Delta elevations.
RC - ReCalculation toggle.  This is a toggle switch (ON/OFF) controlling
     recalculation after editing a point.  If you are editing many points
     then shut recalculation off, after all the points have been edited
     toggle recalc. ON(TRUE) and edit the lowest point number again so that
     recalculation will effect (update) the edited points.
BU - Back Up the point file.  This is usally done before a balance
     procedure so that the raw field data is saved
CO - COmunications parameters of the RS-232 ports are set. Also you may
     capture data from a serial device connected to a COM port.
PS - Printer Setup is use to change the number of characters per inch
     printed.  The printer specific data is in an ASCII file named PRINT.CFG.
     You may modify this file for your printer; use the same file format.


AD - Add points to file.
     This option is the main way to get data into the computer from
     your field book.  It will allow you to enter both horizontal and
     vertical data. First you enter a From point number.  This number must
     be less than the point number of the point you are entering.  If
     you want to enter coordinates directly then enter zero(0) for
     the From point number.  Note: This is called a From point system and
     is dynamic in nature. This means that all points have been
     created by coming from another point unless the From point
     number is zero. Being dynamic in nature means that if a From
     point (of a point) changes coordinates then the point defined
     from the From point can change if the dynamic system is active.
     Points can be deactivated from the dynamics of the From point
     system by entering a 0 or negative From point in the From point
     data position.

Back Site Point (BSPt).
     This point is the back site point of the From point.  If you are
     using angles turned left or right then the BS point is used.
     The BS angle is usually zero but can be modified as desired for
     each point entered.  The BS angle edit option is set on under
     option SE-SEtting.  If the BS point is greater than the From
     point then the From point is automatically protect from dynamic
    interaction.  This is necessary to maintain the integrity of the
     dynamic point system. Why? During recalculation of the point
     system the computer works from lower point number to higher
     point number.  OK, now a particular point gets dynamically
     updated with a BS point > From point.  It is now possible that
     the BS point can also get dynamically updated hence the intended
     BS angle changed.  So to avoid this as stated above if a BS
     point > From point then the BS point gets protected.

Setup:
     This is a YES/NO option, it simple tells the user if this point
     is a setuppoint. It is also linked to the HI data position in
     that if Setup is NO then you can not enter an HI to the HI data
     position. While we are on the subject of HI, this is required so
     that vertical calculation can be dynamically carried through.
     Important: Since this is a dynamic system of data points, if you
     setup on a point with a new HI value and other points have
     already been calculated with the old HI then to maintain the pt
     elevations properly you must handle this one of two ways. 1.
     Protect all the points that use the first HI so that during
     dynamic point update there elevation remains intact. 2. Duplicate
     the Setup point to another point then use the duplicate point as
     the From point for your new point observation data.  You can
     safely enter any HI value this way with out corrupting other
     points.

    ****  You must remember that this is a Dynamic System of Points.  ****

Description:
     This is a 20 character field that is use to describe a point. It
     can be any data you wish.  It is strongly recommended that a
     description of some type be entered for eachpoint. The reason is
     that you can quickly tell what a point is in the field, and
     during cogo operations.

Azimuth:
     This field is used for entering angle data to a point. You enter
     an azimuth in the DDD-MM-SS format. There are 3 optional letters
     that also can go in this field: 1:  A - for azimuth. 2:  R -
     Right angle. 3:  L - Left angle.

     There are two ways to define direction, by (1) azimuth or angle
     turned right or left.  All angle input methods can be handled
     from the AZIMUTH data entry position and the HZ-ANG field with
     the above options. If you enter an R or L  the next added point
     will use the angle turn method by default, and the entry will be
     in the HORZANG data entry position. From the HORZANG data entry
     position you may use the above 3 letters (A,R,L) to toggle
     between entry modes at will. The BEARING data entry position can
     be used by entering a bearing (ex. SW 10-20-30 or 30-40-10 NE or
     s25-20e ). You optionally enter data in this field after the
     AZIMUTH data is entered. You may press the <RETURN> key from the
     AZIMUTH data field to jump directly to the BEARING field.  If
     you enter a valid bearing then the previous entry to the AZIMUTH
     field is ignored.

Distance:
     This data entry field is used to enter a distance in 1 of 4
     ways. 1: H - Horizontal 2: R - Rod shot with vertical angle. 3:
     P - Prism shot using a total station. 4: E - EDM shot.

     The formulas that reduce the slope distance for these type of
     shots are activated by entering a letter (H,R,P,E) with the
     distance.  The default method letter will show when you enter
     the DISTANCE data entry field.  You do not need to type the
     default letter if this is the method required for the distance
     data enter. If R,P,E is used then the next data entered will be
     the vertical angle of that shot.

Important:

     All vertical angles are measured from the zenith, hence 90-00-00
     is a level shot >90 is down hill <90 is up hill.  If the
     vertical angle is greater than 180 then it is reduced,  Vert_Ang
     = 360 - VA.

Rod (Rod shot):

     If you want elevations to be calculated you must enter a rod
     shot. After entering the rod shot then the computer will ask you
     for either the delta elevation or the vertical angle, depending
     on the input mode set in the SEtting option. Delta elevations
     are computed by Total stations.  If your instrument reads out
     delta elevation then it is much quicker to enter delta elevation
     than vertical angles.  However, if you are entering DISTANCE data
     in the (Rod, Prism, EDM) mode then you must use the vertical
     angle input mode, the vertical angle will already be entered for
     vertical calculation so that you may press the <RETURN> key when
     the cursor jumps back to the Vert_Ang data entry position. If
     you enter a rod shot of 0 then you may enter an elevation
     directly. Remember that 0.000 elevation is handled as if no
     elevation is present for this point.

HI:
     The HI is used for vertical calculation of points that come from
     the point being entered.  This value can only be set if Setup is
     YES.

EDit option:
     The edit option is used to fix errors in data entry. It operates
     the same as the add option.

DElete point option:
     This option is used to delete points.  Deleted points are
     flagged as delete by entering the letters DEL in the first 3
     characters of the description.  Deleted points may still be used.
     Deleted points at the end of the file can be deleted from the
     file with th CLEAN UP procedure.  Clean up will reduce the number
     of points in the file.  Only deleted points that are successive
     at the end of the file may be cleaned from the file.  Deleted
     points still in the file are just flagged and can still be
     used.  The only time deleted points are ignored are in the PLOT
     procedure, in that they will not be plotted at the time that all
     points are plotted previous to line drawing commands.

INsert point option:
     This option is used to insert a point, all points are shifted
     down so that a point can be inserted.  This is used rarely: Say
     that you are entering map data to check the map, after entering
     100 legs you find out 1 leg has been left out. You may insert
     this leg so that the map check will close. Be aware that point
     numbers will change, You might not want point numbers to change.
     INsert will ask you for a point numbers to begin the downward
     point shift.  From points and BS points will automatically be
     adjusted for the point shift. The inserted point will have 0
     data entries, therefore you should use the edit option to enter
     the proper data for the inserted point.

SD- Set Digitizer
     The standard digitizer driver is a Houston Instruments full size
     pad. This option is used to set a page on the digitizer. Every
     time a page is placed on the digitizer the SD command must be
     used. First you digitize a origin point. This origin point must
     be a point with either known coordinates or a known point
     number.  Next, the computer asks if you wish to enter
     coordinates or point numbers. Point numbers are quicker to enter
     than coordinates. Next you are asked if you want to orient the
     plot page by a Grid on the page or by AZIMUTH (another known
     point). Most of the time two known points are known, so that the
     new page can be set quickly.  The X-Y scales are then calculated
     so that you can be sure everything is correct. Note: you can use
     the grid orientation to set for a double scale drawing (like a
     road profile) to obtain areas for cut-fill calculations. After
     Set Digitizer is complete the digitizer pad becomes an active
     part of the Survey System.

DA-Digitizer Add
     This option is used to get coordinate data from the digitizer
     quickly into the point file.

Notes on digitizer:
     The digitizer utilizes a point search function to return a
     existing point in the point file.  This feature is utilized by
     pressing the #1 key on the digitizer key pad.  If the #1 key is
     used and an existing point is not found then no point is
     returned.  If you want the coordinates of a point that does not
     exist in the point file then you should press the #2 key.  An
     audio sound indicates if an existing point has been found.   The
     #3 key will not search for an existing point, this is useful for
     digitizing points that are close together such as U.S.G.S.
     contours. If you use any other key except the 3 key then the
     program will search for an existing point.

AR-ARea Computation
     There are 3 ways that areas can be computed: 1:Keyboard  - Point
     data comes from the keyboard. 2:Digitizer - Point data comes
     from the digitizer. 3:File - Point data comes from a file.

     The file input is very useful because a record of the areas is
     kept and can easily be modified.  The file format is as follows:
     ex. 001  1 3 6 9 12 -13 -14 50 0 55 33 1 Subdivision Lot #1 In
     the above example the 1st number represents the lot number for
     identification.  This number may be any integer type number. If
     this number is <0 then an area accumulator will print its value
     and then reset to 0. Next you enter the point numbers of the area
     you want, consecutively. For circles enter PC as a positive
     number, the center as a negative number and the PT + or -
     depending if the arc chord area is included or not included.
     Above circle is 12 -13 -14. You may also use thru point
     numbering in both directions. This is accomplished by entering
     the starting point then a 0 to indicate THRU then the ending
     point number.  All of the point numbers between will be included
     in the area calculations. Above  50 0 55 means 50 51 52 53 54 55
     Finally you must close the area with the first number entered.
     You may also enter an optional comment to aid in lot
     identification. The keyboard input area function works
     identically to the file input area function. The digitizer input
     is simple. Setup the digitizer (SD),  now digitize the desired
     area.  To close the area Press the * key on the cursor pad.  The
     cursor need not be over the closure pt again to close.  Also you
     may keep digitized points for another area calculation.  This is
     useful to get the exact size for a specified lot area.  If you
     do not want to keep any points press 00 on the cursor keypad. To
     exit press then # key on the pad. While in the digitize mode all
     computer control is through the digitizer keypad.  You may also
     redigitize a incorrect point by digitizing the correct point
     with the 9 key. If you want get the area of points that are
     already in the data base then use the 1 key,  this will cause
     only data base points to be returned to the area calculation
     matrix.  Use the 2 key to digitize any point into the area
     calculation matrix.

OF-OFfset cogo function.
     This function is very useful for finding circle center points for
     reverse curves.  It will intersect two lines that are offset
     perpendicularly to two known lines.  Offset right is clock-wise,
     left Counter Clock-wise.

Balance
     The balance procedure uses the compass rule to balance
     coordinates. First you enter the CLOSE TO Pt#,  this allows you
     to close any loop.  The traverse should be run in the following
     manner in order for the balance system to work properly: Pt#1 is
     used for the coordinate base.  Pt#2 comes from Pt#1 and is used
     to orient the survey, with a starting azimuth. Pt#3 comes from
     Pt#2 BS to Pt#1 and is the first angle turned.  If Pt#1 is part of
     the traverse then the closure point is back to Pt#2. If Pt#1 is a
     BS spur not in the traverse the closure is to PT#3 hence you
     must set on Pt#2 again to measure the closure angle to Pt#3.

The following are two examples of how to balance a traverse loop:

Example 1.  Point #1 is a spur off the close traverse.
            Say there are 5 points in the traverse loop.

Important:
     In the above examples point #1 and point #2 coordinates are not
     adjusted. If you have shots that come from point #1 or #2 then
     you should either use Point #6 as the From point or copy point
     #6 coordinates into point #1 and point #7 coordinates into point
     #2.

     Plotting is accomplished by entering a series of simple commands
     into a file that has the same name as the point file that you
     are using, plus the file extension .LN (ex. Mt-View.LN). The
     commands are entered into the file using an editor.  The editor
     that is best suited for this operation is SIDEKICK.  SIDEKICK
     can be activated for use while you are running the survey
     program.  Make sure that the baud rate and serial word frame is
     setup using the DOS system MODE command before plotting (ex.
     MODE COM1:9600,N,8,1).  This command can be entered into the
     AUTOEXEC.BAT file so that at system statup the baud rate is
     automatically setup.

AN-Angle math.
     This option is for adding and subtracting angles.  If you want
     to use a bearing instead of an angle press <RETURN> at the Enter
     angle ? prompt and the computer will ask for a bearing.  Press
     the equal sign (=) to terminate angle math.

CU-Curve computations.
    This option is used to calculate varible of a circle given any
    two variables.

Important:
     Make sure you use the exit function (EX) before turning the
     computer off. This will tell MS-DOS to flush disk write buffers,
     assuring that no point data is lost.

Trademarks:
     MS-DOS (Microsoft Corpration), Sidekick (Borland Inc.), IBM PC
     (International Business Machines).

Abreviations:
     COGO    = coordinate geometry.
     EDM     = electronic distance measuring device
     pt      = point
     no.     = number
     el/elev = elevation

Marker Slant stay in effect until next Line Plotted.
Multi_line will draw Markers if the last line drawn had a Marker Drawn.
You can turn X-Hair on/off to cross Circle/Squares or to high lite points.
X-Hair (Line_Ends) on/off is also controlled on the 1st line of the Line file.

Varables Current_Marker & Current_Marker_Size are updated when the
Marker size changes.  All Line Markers use these variables to drawn the
line end markers.  You Can change then end markers with the Set_Marker Code.

You May Put comments in the line file after Label_Types,
   Like  Traverse, Lot Lay Out, Ect.

To Draw Marker using command [6,7] first draw a single line using [0,1]
and turn draw marker on. (ex. 1 12 13 2 0 1 n)

If you do not wish to draw markers with command codes [6,7] then
(ex. 1 12 13 0 1 n) before using [6,7].

There is a variable Draw_Marker that is set on the last line drawn using
command codes [0,1,4,5] not [6,7].

Label Angle (Lab-Ang) is used for labels that are Perpendicular to the line
being labeled.  If Lab_ang>0 then this angle will be used for these labels
else it will be perpendicular.  Lab_ang is off the Due eEast Line.

If tyou want a Label to be on the other side of a line then plot the
line in the other direction.

To make thing much easier use comment in the line file to set off blocks
of lines so that you can find them.
Also block line together that are related.

Use code 99 to ignor a command that you might want to restore later.

You can make many things happen with this system by THINKING about it,
This is actually a plotting program langauage.

Set the orentation of a marker by Marker_slant in Set_marker command
or draw a line with the proper orientation before Draw Marker command.
You might use the no_line code.
The Variable Cur_slant is set either way.  When line are draw with markers
on the markers will get oriented properly automatically.
